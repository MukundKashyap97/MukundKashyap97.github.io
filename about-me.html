<h2 id="hello-im-mukund">Hello, I’m Mukund!</h2>
<p>I’m currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Computational Materials Science from TU Bergakademie Freiberg, Germany. I’m enthusiastic about the abilities afforded by programming concepts in engineering disciplines such as Mechanical engineering. I am also interested in content generation/blogging. Currently, I’m learning to code in Python, C++, and MATLAB. Shown here is a collection of my work.</p>
